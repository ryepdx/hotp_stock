  In order to check basic quantity on hand handling...
-
  Make sure inventory in company-owned and shared locations shows up in "quantity on hand."
-
  !python {model: product.product}: |
    product = self.browse(cr, ref('user_demo'), ref('product_hemp_knotwork'))
    assert product.qty_available == 25.0, "Inventory in some locations are not accounted for in 'quantity on hand.'"

-
  Make sure inventory in unshared locations don't show up in "quantity on hand."
-
  !python {model: product.product}: |
    product = self.browse(cr, ref('user_demo_pw'), ref('product_hemp_knotwork'))
    assert product.qty_available == 15.0, "Inventory in shared locations are not accounted for in 'quantity on hand.'"

-
  Make sure all inventory lines are accounted for under "inventory_lines"
-
  !python {model: product.product}: |
    self.pool.get("stock.inventory.line").write(
      cr, uid, [ref('stock_inventory_line_0'), ref('stock_inventory_line_1')], {"company_id": ref("res_company_1")})
    product = self.browse(cr, ref('user_demo'), ref('product_hemp_knotwork'))
    print sorted([l.id for l in product.inventory_lines])
    assert sorted([l.id for l in product.inventory_lines]) == [
      ref('stock_inventory_line_0'), ref('stock_inventory_line_1')
    ], "Inventory lines are not accounted for!"
